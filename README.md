# Diamond JS wrapper library

This is a javascript / WASM wrapper around [diamond types](https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types).

This code is currently experimental WIP. Do not trust this for anything important. The API can and will change without notice.

### Building

```
$ wasm-pack build --target nodejs
```

See example.js for a simple usage example. Note the API is in flux and will change.
